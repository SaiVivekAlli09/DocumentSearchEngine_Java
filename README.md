# DocumentSearchEngine_Java

A simple document search engine built in Java using core data structures. Indexes text files and lets users search for keywords in real time.

DocumentSearchEngine is a beginner-friendly Java project that demonstrates how to build a basic search engine using only core Java and custom data structures. The program scans a folder of text files, processes their contents, and creates an inverted index mapping each word to the documents it appears in. Users can then search for keywords via the console, and the engine instantly displays all document names containing those keywords.

This project teaches important concepts such as string manipulation, file I/O, indexing, and efficient search algorithms using HashMaps and Sets. It’s practical and easy to understand, making it ideal for learners who want to strengthen their Java and data structure skills. The DocumentSearchEngine is also easily expandable, allowing for future features like phrase search, ranking, or a graphical interface. It’s a valuable and impressive addition to any Java developer’s portfolio, showcasing both problem-solving and programming fundamentals.
